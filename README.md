## Spring Boot RestAPI beginner project

This is my first project with Java Spring Boot RestAPI. In this project, I discovered one of the
use cases of Spring Boot RestAPI, and it helps to create a relationship between database and object-oriented language.
I look forward to discovering more about Spring Boot and enhancing my arsenal with its beauty.
